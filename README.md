## REBORN: Reverse Engineering for BiOlogical Regulatory Networks ##

This software contains four small parts, dealing with seperate functions in reverse engineering process.
#####1.Map.#####
#####2. Console.#####
#####3. SandBox.#####
#####4. Report.#####

###Map###

**Map** has the function of showing input behaviors including some details about input data such as the minimum value and the maximum value. Map also privdes a quick and direct view of the behavior of the input data. With a clean and neat _Graphic User Interface_, it is very simple for users to check their input. In addtion, **Map** has the connection with **Console**.

###Console###
**Console** undertakes the functions of generating _ODEs_, generating _GRNs_ and rebuilding the system. In **Console**, users can either use the default parameters or input their own parameter. All the calculations begin after _"Let's REBORN"_ is clicked. More over, the whole calculating process will be shown in the _Graphic User Interface_. All the results can be sent to _FTP_. Therefore, users can view the calculating outputs either on _GUI_ or in _FTP_. Apart from the _FTP_ service, **Console** has the interface with other parts of our software, namely **Map**, **Console** and **Report**.
